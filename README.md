# Pandas and Matplotlib Plotting
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data analysis and visualization. Specifically, the script reads in a CSV file containing information about alcohol consumption by country and continent, and then creates several plots to explore the data.

# Dependencies
To run this notebook, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip, a package installer for Python. For example, to install Pandas, you can run the following command:
pip install pandas
Similarly, to install Matplotlib, you can run the following command:
pip install matplotlib

# Conclusion
In this notebook, I demonstrated how to use Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to analyze and visualize data. These powerful libraries offer a wide range of functions for exploring and interpreting data, making it easy to gain insights and make informed decisions based on the data at hand.
